I want to develop a basic nextjs app router website for small business that focuses on window renovation and painting services in Stockholm. The website includes a homepage, an "About" page, a "Projects" page, and a "Contact" page. Each page uses the same layout with "Header", "Content", and "Footer" with the "Content" being the pages content. I want to enable different languages, so all hardcoded text should be in a language file. 

Create an overview SOP file in the @documentation folder and name it overview.md. Outline a feature roadmap with all key files and folers necessary to implement this website. Consider best practices for folder structure and file naming under the nextjs app router. To create the overview file, follow these steps one by one:

1. Review global requirements and dependencies. 
2. Create overview.md file and add the high-level folder structure
3. Add a brief summary at the top of the file answering: 
- What is the purpose of the app? 
- What is the tech-stack of the app?
- What are the best practices used in the app? 
- What is the folder structure of the app? 
- Where are the key functionalities located? 
4. Create the outlined folder structure and fill it with dummy code.
